        Hi there! Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes in the theatre? Do you want to be a part of some of the biggest events on campus? If so then come and join us!

        We are a society at the University of York for anyone with an interest in stage lighting and sound, whether you have had previous experience in shows or have never even set foot in a theatre.

        We hold tech training for anyone who wants to get started, and we provide opportunities to get involved in a wide range of events including shows from The Gilbert and Sulivan Society, CHMS, and more, in venues such as Central Hall and the Dixon Studio.

        We are also able to provide technical assistance to other societies, including lighting and sound equipment and technician hire.
